In December 2019, the German government adopted the <a href = "https://www.bmfsfj.de/jugendstrategie" target="_blank" onclick="return confirm_alert('the Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth','En');">Youth Strategy</a>. This describes the initial situation, derives needs for action and defines measures, including in the area of employment. This means that Germany has an operationalized youth strategy.
