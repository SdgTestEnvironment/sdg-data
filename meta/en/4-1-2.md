data_footnotes: - Lower secondary level = ISCED 2 
  - Upper secondary level = ISCED 3<br>• All persons who have at least one qualification from the ISCED levels are recorded.<br>•  At primary level (ISCED 1), no formal qualification is acquired with promotion to the 5th grade. A measurement by participation in lower secondary education is not practical due to the compulsory school attendance in Germany.
