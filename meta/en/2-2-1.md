data_footnotes: 'Data for KiGGS Wave 2 (2014 to 2017) are only available for 3- and 4-year-olds: published in Schienkiewitz et al (2018) Prävalenz von Untergewicht, Übergewicht und Adipositas bei Kindern und Jugendlichen in Deutschland – Einordnung der Ergebnisse aus KiGGS Welle 2 nach internationalen Referenzsystemen. Journal of Health Monitoring 3(3): 60–74. DOI 10.17886/RKI-GBE-2018-080<br>• To ensure comparability with KiGGS Wave 2, the restriction to the age group for 3- and 4-year-olds was also applied to the KiGGS baseline survey. For the KiGGS baseline survey, the weighting including education was standardized to the sample as of December 31, 2015. There may be deviations from earlier calculations.<br>• A direct comparison with the sustainability indicators is not possible, as these indicators were calculated using a different reference system (according to Kromeyer-Hauschild). There are differences here, which are described in detail in the above-mentioned publication.<br>• The data 2003-2006 are age-standardised prevalences (population status: 31.12.2015).'
