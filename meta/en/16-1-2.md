data_footnotes: The data is based on a special evaluation and is not publicly available.<br>• For recorded victims, the year of the offence can also be before the reporting year (outgoing statistics). Persons who were recorded as victims more than once in the reporting year are counted more than once accordingly. <br>• In contrast to the police crime statistics (PKS), the average population is used to calculate the number of victims per 100,000 inhabitants instead of the population as of 31 December of the previous year. <br>• For 2010, the population was calculated backwards using the 2011 census and migration, birth and death statistics.
