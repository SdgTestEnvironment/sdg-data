This indicator is marked as not applicable for the provision of national time series. Possible reasons are:
-	The indicator is a global indicator that is to say the provision of national data for this indicator would not be meaningful.

-	The indicator is classified as not applicable due to other reasons, for example following the relevant European classification by Eurostat.
