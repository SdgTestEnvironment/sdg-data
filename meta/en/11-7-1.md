# Nationale Metadaten
national_indicator_available: Share of open space to total area in cities with more than 100&nbsp;000 inhabitants
comparison_sdg: The time series is compliant with the global metadata. It is based on remote sensing derived information land cover data. As a constraint, it must be mentioned that it cannot be determined which of these areas are publicly and freely accessible. For this reason, only potential open public spaces can be identified here, similarly to the description in the global metadata ("Spatial analysis to identify potential open public spaces").
