The Water Framework Directive came into force in December 2000. The aim of the directive is to provide a framework for the protection of inland surface waters, transitional waters, coastal waters and the groundwater. The directive has been implemented at national level in the <a href="https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/whg_2009/index.html" >Water Resources Act (WHG) </a> and in the water laws of the Länder, as well as through the issuing of ordinances by the Länder.
