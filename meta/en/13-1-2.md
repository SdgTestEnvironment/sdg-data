In March 2015, Germany committed itself to implementing the United Nations (UN) Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030. The national focal point for the Sendai Framework is the Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance (BBK).<br><br>
In December 2008, the German Strategy for<a href="https://www.bmu.de/en/topics/climate-energy/climate/adaptation-to-climate-change/">Adaptation to Climate Change</a> was adopted by the German government. The strategy sets a framework for adapting to the consequences of climate change.<br>
<br>
In addition, the <a href="https://www.bmu.de/en/law/act-to-further-improve-preventive-flood-control-and-simplify-flood-protection-procedures/">Act to Further Improve Preventive Flood Control (Flood Control Act)</a> regulates nationwide requirements for the prevention of flood damages. The law came into force in May 2005.
