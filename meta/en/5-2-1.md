data_footnotes: 'All data revised. <br>• Data are only available from 2018 due to methodological changes. <br>• For recorded victims, the year of the offence can also be before the reporting year (outgoing statistics). <br>• Persons who were recorded as victims more than once in the reporting year are counted more than once accordingly. <br>• Female victims of sexual violence by an intimate partner: 2020 preliminary data. In contrast to the police crime statistics (PKS), the average population is used to calculate the number of victims per 100,000 inhabitants instead of the population as of December 31 of the previous year. For 2010, the population was calculated backwards using the 2011 census and migration, birth and death statistics.'
