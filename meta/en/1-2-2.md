data_footnotes: 'Deprivation is defined as economic restriction and the lack of durable consumer goods for financial reasons.<br>• As of reference year 2020 there have been two types of results: first and final results. The results currently shown are final results. The "Leben in Europa" survey (German name of the European Union Statistics on Income and Living Conditions - EU-SILC), which was conducted separately in the past, was integrated as a subsample into the microcensus in 2020. Comparing the data of reference year 2020 with those of previous years is not possible (break in the time series) as the voluntary survey was changed over to a partly compulsory survey and the composition of the sample was changed.'
