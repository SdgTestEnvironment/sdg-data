data_footnote: Due to methodological changes, the data are only comparable to a limited extend. By the end of 2016, the real estate cadastre had been converted to ALKIS. The changeover also introduced a new system of types of use, which has an impact on the comparability of the data over time. The conversion to ALKIS was carried out at different times in the federal states and spanned a total period of nine years.
