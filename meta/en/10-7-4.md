data_footnotes: 'The indicator measures the proportion of German nationals who are refugees abroad per 100,000 inhabitants of Germany rather than the number of refugees living in Germany.<br>• For 2010, the population was calculated backwards using the 2011 census and migration, birth and death statistics.<br>• According to Article 1A of the Geneva Convention, a refugee is a person who "owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country".'
