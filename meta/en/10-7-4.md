data_footnote: From 2010 the population update data are based on the 1987 census and from 2011 on the 2011 census. Some of the people seeking protection who came to Germany in 2015 were only registered during 2016. For that reason, the numbers of people seeking protection as at 31 December 2015 are too low.
